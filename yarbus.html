<img SRC="yarbus1.gif" BORDER=3 height=186 width=118 align=LEFT><img SRC="yarbus2.gif" HSPACE=15 BORDER=3 height=186 width=118 align=LEFT>These
two pictures are taken from the works of the Russian psycho-physicist <i><font color="#2E8B57">Yarbus</font></i>,
dating back to the 1950s. The picture on the right shows the trace of the
gaze of a subject exploring the portrait on the left. Yarbus demonstrated
that human beings, as these pictures show us, do not scan a scene in a
raster-like fashion. They rather perform <i><font color="#2E8B57">jumps</font></i>,
known as <b>saccades</b>, between the different points of interest, on
which <b>fixation</b> is maintained for a short period.
<p>We <i>do not</i> use saccades to paint a complete internal representation
of a visual scene. A few experiments suggest that we rather rely on the
external word for storing information and only remember <i><font color="#2E8B57">pointers</font></i>
to relevant locations in the scene. We then make use of saccades to retrieve
the information as we need it. Therefore, <i>s<font color="#2E8B57">accades
constitute a way to select task relevant information</font></i>. This is
confirmed by the fact that, as Yarbus already noticed, the saccadic pattern
<font color="#000000">depends
on the cognitive task</font> to be performed.
<p>In these images we remark that most of the time is spent looking at
the eyes and the mouth. Other studies show that these are the regions we
mostly rely on for face recognition. We therefore focus on those regions
for our Facial Features detection and Face Authentication algorithms.
