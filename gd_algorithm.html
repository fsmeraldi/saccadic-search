<h1>
A Common GD Based Algorithm<br>
(and its shortcomings)</h1></center>
A common Gabor Decompositon based pattern-recognition algorithm can be
schematically described as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=10 >
<tr>
<td>
<h2>
Training</h2>
An appearance-based model of the pattern of interest (in this case, an
eye) is encoded as a <i><font color="#2E8B57">vector of Gabor responses</font></i>.
<p>This realistically involves averaging over a certain number of subjects
(the training set).
<p>More generally, response vectors from the images in the training set
could be used to train a classifier.</td>

</tr>
</table>

<table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=10 >
<tr>
<td><img SRC="distmap.gif" height=295 width=377 align=LEFT></td>

<td>
<h2> Search</h2>
When looking from the pattern on a new image, <i><font color="#2E8B57">a
Gabor feature vector is extracted at each point</font></i>.
<p><font color="#2E8B57"><i>The vector is compared against the model</i>.</font>
The resulting distance map is expected to have a <i><font color="#2E8B57">minimum</font></i>
at the location of the pattern we are looking for, were the feature vector
best resembles the model.
<p>Here again, the distance map could represent the output of a classifier
rating each image pixel.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Disadvantages</h2>

The main problem with this approach is that the Gabor decomposition must
be computed <i><font color="#2E8B57">everywhere in the image</font></i>.
This requires, in practice, working in the Fourier domain and is therefore
<i><font color="#2E8B57">time
consuming</font></i>.
<p>This common algorithm as it stands is therefore ill-suited for active
vision applications.
