<h1>Face Authentication</h1></center>

The Gabor features obtained by placing the <a href="retina.html">retinotopic
sampling grid</a> over the eyes and the mouth of a subject constitute <i><font color="#2E8B57">reliable
biometrics</font></i> for face authentication.
<p>Robust face authentication can be achieved by <i><font color="#2E8B57">fusing</font></i>
the output of <font color="#2E8B57"><i>three</i> <i>independent experts</i></font>,
which are implemented by means of <i><font color="#2E8B57">SVM classifiers</font></i>.
Each of the experts is trained to authenticate the client based on the
features extracted by placing the retinotopic grid over his left eye, right
eye or mouth.
<p>The database used in our experiments is a subset of the first multi-modal
verification oriented database collected by the <i><a href="http://www.tele.ucl.ac.be/M2VTS/">M2VTS
consortium</a></i>. It consists of four series of images of 37 people taken
at different periods of time. Each series contains two to four frontal
images of each subject. Appearance of subjects varies widely across the
different series. Tests are performed according to a leave-one-out rotation
scheme knows as "Brussels Protocol". At each step, one person is removed
from the database to act as impostor. Also, one entire image series is
set aside for client tests. The 36 persons remaining act as registered
clients, and their three image series are available for training. By choosing
the impostor and the test series in all possible ways, <font color="#2E8B57">36x37x4=5328</font>
essentially different <i><font color="#2E8B57">client tests</font></i>
and the same number of <i><font color="#2E8B57">impostor tests</font></i>
can be generated.
<p>Experiments performed by manually placing the retinotopic sampling grid
over the eyes and mouth of the subjects in the M2VTS database indicate
that <b><font color="#2E8B57">an Equal Error Rate as low as 0.2% can be
achieved</font></b>. This constitutes a dramatic improvement over other
techniques, which yielded a 5% EER on the same database.
